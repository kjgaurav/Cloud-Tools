1. Ansible

Ansible is an open source IT Configuration Management, Deployment & Orchestration tool.
It aims to provide large productivity gains to a wide variety of automation challenges.
This tool is very simple to use yet powerful enough to automate complex multi-tier IT application environments.

Key Features:

1. Simple: Ansible uses a simple syntax written in YAML called playbooks. YAML is a human-readable data serialization language.
2. Agentless: Finally, Ansible is completely agentless. There are no agents/software or additional firewall ports that you need to install on the  client systems or hosts which you want to automate.
3. Powerful & Flexible: Ansible has powerful features that can enable us to model even the most complex IT workflows.
4. Configuration Management : Ansible is designed to be very simple, reliable and consistent for configuration management. 
5. Orchestration: Ansible provides Orchestration in the sense of aligning the business request with the applications, data, and infrastructure.
6. Security and Compliance: When we define our security policy in Ansible, scanning and remediation of site-wide security policy can be integrated into other automated processes. And it’ll be integral in everything that is deployed. It means that, you need to configure your security details once in your control machine and it will be embedded in all other nodes automatically. 
7. Application Deployment: When we define our application with Ansible, and manage the deployment with Ansible Tower, teams are able to effectively manage the entire application life cycle from development to production.

USE CASES
Complete IT automation
Ansible seamlessly unites workflow orchestration with configuration management, provisioning, and application deployment in one easy-to-use and deploy platform.
Regardless of where you start with Ansible, you’ll find our simple, powerful and agentless automation platform has the capabilities to solve your most challenging problems.

1. Provisioning : Your apps have to live somewhere. If you’re PXE booting and kickstarting bare-metal servers or VMs, or creating virtual or cloud instances from templates, Ansible and Red Hat® Ansible® Tower help streamline the process.
2. Configuration Management : Centralizing configuration file management and deployment is a common use case for Ansible, and it’s how many power users are first introduced to the Ansible automation platform.
3. Application Deployment : When you define your application with Ansible, and manage the deployment with Ansible Tower, teams are able to effectively manage the entire application lifecycle from development to production.
4. Continuous Delivery : Creating a CI/CD pipeline requires buy-in from numerous teams. You can’t do it without a simple automation platform that everyone in your organization can use. Ansible Playbooks keep your applications properly deployed (and managed) throughout their entire lifecycle.
5. Security & Compliance :When you define your security policy in Ansible, scanning and remediation of site-wide security policy can be integrated into other automated processes and instead of being an afterthought, it’ll be integral in everything that is deployed.
6. Orchestration : Configurations alone don’t define your environment. You need to define how multiple configurations interact and ensure the disparate pieces can be managed as a whole. Out of complexity and chaos, Ansible brings order.

USE CASE:
1) Provisioning
Automate, manage and connect all stages of an application lifecycle

From traditional bare metal through to serverless or function-as-a-service, automating the provisioning of any infrastructure is the first step in automating the operational life cycle of your applications. Ansible can provision the latest cloud platforms, virtualized hosts and hypervisors, network devices and bare-metal servers.
After bootstrapping, nodes can be connected to storage, added to a load balancer, security patched or any number of other operational tasks by separate teams. In essence Ansible becomes the connecting tool in any of your process pipelines – taking bare infrastructure right through to day to day management, automatically.

Provisioning with Ansible allows you to seamlessly transition into configuration management, orchestration and application deployment using the same simple, human readable, automation language.

Infrastructure Platforms
Baremetal

Underneath virtualization and cloud platforms there is always the physical server. When it's your own cloud or hypervisor system you still need to provision bare metal some of the time. Ansible integrates with many datacenter management tools to both invoke and enact the provisioning steps required.
Virtualized

Hypervisors, virtual storage and virtual networks – the transition from physical devices as the base platform has opened up increasingly diverse scenarios at previously unavailable scale. Tame the complexity with Ansible to simplify the experience of cross platform management. The large selection of available modules gives you the flexibility and choice to manage your diverse environment.
Networks

Ansible Network Automation allows users to configure, validate and ensure continuous compliance for physical network devices. Ansible is the only language that can easily provision across multi-vendor environments, often replacing the need for manual processes that exist across network environments.
Storage

Ansible can provision and manage the storage in your infrastructure. From software-defined  storage, cloud based storage, or even hardware storage appliances, you can find a module to leverage Ansible’s common, powerful language.
Cloud
Public Cloud

Ansible is packaged with hundreds of modules supporting services on the largest public cloud platforms. Compute, storage and networking modules allow playbooks to directly provision these services. Ansible can even act as an orchestrator of other popular provisioning tools, giving you a high level, self documented, workflow.
Private Cloud

One of the easiest ways to deploy, configure and orchestrate OpenStack private cloud is using Ansible. Ansible can be used to provision the underlying infrastructure, install services, add compute hosts, and more. Once the underlying environment is provisioned, Ansible can also be used provision resources, services, and applications inside of your cloud.
Self-Service with Ansible Tower

Red Hat Ansible Tower helps you scale IT automation, manage complex deployments and speed productivity. Centralize and control your IT infrastructure with a visual dashboard, role-based access control, job scheduling, integrated notifications and graphical inventory management. And Ansible Tower's REST API and CLI make it easy to embed Ansible Tower into existing tools and processes.
