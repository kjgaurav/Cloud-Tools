1. Ansible

Ansible is an open source IT Configuration Management, Deployment & Orchestration tool. It aims to provide large productivity gains to a wide variety of automation challenges. This tool is very simple to use yet powerful enough to automate complex multi-tier IT application environments.

Key Features:

1. Simple: Ansible uses a simple syntax written in YAML called playbooks. YAML is a human-readable data serialization language.
2. Agentless: Finally, Ansible is completely agentless. There are no agents/software or additional firewall ports that you need to install on the  client systems or hosts which you want to automate.
3. Powerful & Flexible: Ansible has powerful features that can enable us to model even the most complex IT workflows.
4. Configuration Management : Ansible is designed to be very simple, reliable and consistent for configuration management. 
5. Orchestration: Ansible provides Orchestration in the sense of aligning the business request with the applications, data, and infrastructure.
6. Security and Compliance: When we define our security policy in Ansible, scanning and remediation of site-wide security policy can be integrated into other automated processes. And it’ll be integral in everything that is deployed. It means that, you need to configure your security details once in your control machine and it will be embedded in all other nodes automatically. 
7. Application Deployment: When we define our application with Ansible, and manage the deployment with Ansible Tower, teams are able to effectively manage the entire application life cycle from development to production.

2. Chef

Chef is an automation tool that provides a way to define infrastructure as code. Infrastructure as code (IAC) simply means that managing infrastructure by writing code (Automating infrastructure) rather than using manual processes. It can also be termed as programmable infrastructure. Chef uses a pure-Ruby, domain-specific language (DSL) for writing system configurations. Below are the types of automation done by Chef, irrespective of the size of infrastructure:

    Infrastructure configuration
    Application deployment 
    Configurations are managed across your network
    
1. Chef uses popular Ruby language to create a domain-specific language.
2. Chef does not make assumptions on the current status of a node. It uses its mechanisms to get the current status of machine.
3. Chef is ideal for deploying and managing the cloud server, storage, and software.
4. Lower barrier for entry − As Chef uses native Ruby language for configuration, a standard configuration language it can be easily picked up by anyone having some development experience.
5. Excellent integration with cloud − Using the knife utility, it can be easily integrated with any of the cloud technologies. It is the best tool for an organization that wishes to distribute its infrastructure on multi-cloud environment.

3. Puppet
4. Terraform
