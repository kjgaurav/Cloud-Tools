Solutions & Features:
1. Continuous Data Protection (CDP) - Replicate data as block changes occur, recover to any point in time, and archive with virtually no data loss.

3. Protect Your Business And Your Brand From Ransomware - Pinpoint Attacks with Zerto Analytics, Use network reports within Zerto Analytics to find unusual behavior in generated changes and pinpoint the timeframe of malware attacks.
4. Zerto Eliminate Storage Vendor Lock-In - Zerto launched hypervisor-based replication which is completely storage agnostic and can replicate from any storage brand or technology to any other.

Zerto works regardless of your underlying infrastructure, meaning you can mix and match storage, clouds, and hypervisors.
